# Machine-Learning-For-3D-Geometry
This repository contains the my work on the assignments for the Machine Learning for 3D Geometry (ML43D) course at Technical University of Munich (TUM). 
The lecture aims to explore state-of-the-art algorithms for both supervised and unsupervised machine learning on 3D data, 
for both analysis and synthesis of 3D shapes and scenes.
